# Project 5: ConnectFourIn this project you will develop a ConnectFour game using object-oriented concepts. **You may work as a team of 2-3 or alone.**Begin by downloading [project5.zip](project5.zip) and unzip it. You should see the following files:

   * `game.py`: main program to play game **DO NOT MODIFY**
   * `connectfour.py`: where you will write your project code
   * `csplot.py`: helper functions to draw the game **DO NOT MODIFY**You should only have to modify `connectfour.py` and ***not*** `csplot.py` or `game.py`.
## Step 1: Understand `ConnectFour`

Open up `connectfour.py` and look at the `ConnectFour` class. Familiarize yourself with its attributes (fields) and how the methods are implemented. Pay special attention to how you might implement making a move and determining who the winner is.

Run `game.py` & submit a screenshot for check point 1. You may have to hit Control-C to kill the game if closing the window does not work.

## Step 2: `makeMove`

Implement the `makeMove` method. Adhere to the method's comment description when implementing the method.

Then, test `makeMove` by running `game.py`. Take a screenshot & submit a screenshot for check point 2 (make sure to show your code & a board with colored tiles).

## Step 3: `_isWon`

Implement `_isWon` to determine if a player has won. You may want to try implementing it for the tic tac toe game we looked at in class (`tictactoe2.py`), and then see how your solution could be adapted to go from looking at 3 spots to 4.

Run `game.py` to test your game. When you've tested that both players can win, you're ready to submit.

<!--Draw a UML diagram of the given code. Example for the Date class:
-->

## Extra Credit: Smarter computer player

For extra credit, change `_computerMakeMove` to be more intelligent & actively prevent the human player from winning.

## Extra Credit: Checkers

Implement support in `ConnectFour` to play a checkers game. Write your own `checkers.py` main program to run that instead of `ConnectFour`.

## Submission

Make sure you've added your name to the comments at the top of the file, that your program contains comments and follows good programming style.

Once youâ€™re satisfied that your game is working correctly, zip it for submission:

  * `cd ..`
  * `zip project5_uLogin.zip project5_uLogin/*`
