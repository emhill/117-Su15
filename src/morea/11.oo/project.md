# Project 5: ConnectFourIn this project you will develop a ConnectFour game using object-oriented concepts. **You may work as a team of 2-3 or alone.**Begin by downloading [project5.zip](project5.zip) and unzip it. You should see the following files:

   * `game.py`: main program to play game **DO NOT MODIFY**
   * `connectfour.py`: where you will write your project code
   * `csplot.py`: helper functions to draw the game **DO NOT MODIFY**
**Steps:**

  1. Open up `connectfour.py` and look at the `ConnectFour` class. Familiarize yourself with its attributes and how the methods are implemented.
  2. Uncomment the `makeMove` method and its comment and implement the method. Adhere to the method's comment description when implementing the method.
  3. Uncomment the code in the play method to test `makeMove`. Run `game.py` to test.
  4. Implement `_isWon` to determine if a player has won.
  4. Uncomment the code in the play method to test `_isWon`.
  4. Run `game.py` to test your game.

You should only have to modify `connectfour.py` and ***not*** `csplot.py` or `game.py`. You may have to hit Control-C to kill the game if closing the window does not work.

## Submission

Make sure you've added your name to the comments at the top of the file, that your program contains comments and follows good programming style.

Once youâ€™re satisfied that your game is working correctly, zip it for submission:

  * `cd ..`
  * `zip project5_uLogin.zip project5_uLogin/*`
