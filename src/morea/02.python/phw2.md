## UNIX Setup

Access a UNIX command line by going to: [http://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix_terminal_online.php](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix_terminal_online.php)

## Exploring the UNIX command line

Read through the following tutorial: [http://www.davidbaumgold.com/tutorials/command-line/](http://www.davidbaumgold.com/tutorials/command-line/). Then, open your [UNIX terminal](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix_terminal_online.php) and go through the following steps.

1. Let’s create a directory for this class. Type `mkdir csci150`.
1. Type `cd csci150` to move the terminal to that directory
1. Type `touch testfile.txt` to create an empty file
1. Type `ls` in the terminal. Do you see testfile.txt?
1. Type `pwd` to see what directory your terminal is in.
1. Add your name to the file by typing `echo "Your name" > testfile.txt`
1. In the terminal, type `cat testfile.txt`. Is your name displayed?
1. Take a single screenshot of your UNIX terminal window with the above commands.

## Exploring Hardware

Fill in the following blanks with: motherboard, processor, memory, hard drive:

  1. variables are stored in/on ________
  1. the ________ executes program statements
  1. when a program is not being executed, it resides in/on ________
  1. a ________ connects all the components of a computer with a bus

## Binary Encoding

1. How many pieces of information can be conveyed with a single bit?
1. How many bits would you need to represent each of the 50 United States using a unique permutation of bits?
1. How many bits are in a byte?
1. What is the binary representation of the number 3?
1. What is the encoding standard used to convert text into ordinal numbers?

<!--## UNIX Command Overview

For each of the following commands:

A. Briefly describe what it does in your own words. Example: 

    wget downloads files from the internet

If you don't know what a command does, google it. I recommend throwing the word "man" (short for manual) in front of the command.

B. Write a template of how the command is used -- indicate arguments in [brackets]. For example, a template for the wget command would look like this:

    wget [url to download]

Alternatively, the zip command to submit an assignment might look like this:

    zip [folder].zip [folder]/*

C. Take a screenshot of using the command on your terminal, cropping out irrelevant parts. You should make sure the command works in the screen shot.

   Example for **wget**:

   <a href="wget.png"><img src="wget.png" width="500"/></a>

   The example for **remove** also needs to show the file is no longer there:

   <a href="rm.png"><img src="rm.png" width="300"/></a>

Your document should be organized by command -- for example, you should describe the ls command, give its template, and include a cropped screenshot before moving on to the next command, pwd.

**Commands:**

1. ls
1. pwd
1. cd
1. touch
1. mkdir
1. cp
1. mv
1. rm
1. ped
1. cat
1. zip    
1.  .      (not a command, use in conjunction with another command)
1. ..      (not a command, use in conjunction with another command)
1. tab     (no screenshot necessary)
1.  ↑      (no screenshot necessary)

**How to take *& crop* a Screenshot**

- Windows: [www.ehow.com/how_6801557_crop-screen-shot.html](www.ehow.com/how_6801557_crop-screen-shot.html)
- Mac: [http://www.ehow.com/how_4559274_take-edit-screen-shots-mac.html](http://www.ehow.com/how_4559274_take-edit-screen-shots-mac.html)
    - Make sure to use Command (⌘)-K rather than control-K as the article states.
