1. **Variables**: storing information (numbers, text)
1. **Math & Logic**: writing & evaluating expressions
1. **Input/Output (IO)**: getting information from the user (or a file/DB) and displaying information to the screen graphically or with the console
1. **Conditions**: changing what code statements are executed under different scenarios (i.e., if the day is Sunday, sleep in; otherwise, get up at 6 am)
1. **Loops**: repeat code statements (e.g.: while the sink is dirty, keep scrubbing)
1. **Functions**: grouped set of statements to accomplish a task based on parameters (e.g.: given f(x)=x+5 then f(2) would be 7)
1. **Lists**: store multiple pieces of information (e.g.: an array that stores the integers 1-5 or the letters of the alphabet)
