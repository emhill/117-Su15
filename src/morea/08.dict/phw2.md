# Practice HW12: List Comprehensions

In this practice HW you will explore writing some list comprehensions.

<!--{% include wod-times.html Rx="<45 min" Av="45-90 min" Sd="90-135 min" DNF="135+ min" %}-->

Write python code (as a program or in the python interpreter) that prints out the following using list comprehensions of the form:

    print([c for x in sequence])

where c is the computation and x is an element in a sequence. Remember that you can also put an `if` after the sequence to further restrict what elements are added to the list.

You should be able to print:

  * twelve 12's
  * the absolute values from -10 to 10
  * the even numbers from 0 to 100
  * the perfect squares from 0 to 100
  * the number of odd numbers in the range of 0 to 100
  * the number of vowels in the string "Hello, there!"


<!--## Demonstration

Once you've finished doing the HW a single time, you can watch me do it:
