# Project 2: Image ManipulationIn this project...
First, download [project2.zip](project2.zip) and unzip it. You should see the following files:
  * Test images: arch.png, hmcOlinSmall.png, in.png, out.png, spam.png, trees.png  * Programs:
     * image_fun.py: where you will write your project code
     * png.py: library to work with png files **DO NOT MODIFY**
     * png_helper.py: helper functions to manipulate png files **DO NOT MODIFY**

Next, try running the code: `python image_fun.py`. **Make sure to run with python, NOT python3.** If successful, when you `ls` you should see a new file, `out2.png`. Open `out2.png` and `out.png` to make sure they look the same.
