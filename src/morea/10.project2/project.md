# Project 2: Image Manipulation<!--Facebook suggests people you may (or should) be friends with. Netflix suggests movies you might like. Amazon suggests products to buy. How do they do that? In this project, you will learn one simple way to make such suggestions, called “collaborative filtering”. (The actual algorithms used by these companies are closely-guarded trade secrets.) You will apply the skills you’ve learned this semester to implement a python program to visualize a small network of friends using graphviz  as well as make friend recommendations. **You may work with a partner**; make sure both students are clearly identified in the comments to the program. You cannot work with the same partner as on project 1.
