# HW: Recursion III

<!--In this practice HW you will create 2 programs that take code we've previously written for other PHWs and turn them into functions.-->

<!--{% include wod-times.html Rx="<15 min" Av="15-30 min" Sd="30-45 min" DNF="45+ min" %}-->

## triangle.py

Assume we have triangle made of blocks. The topmost row has 1 block, the next row down has 2 blocks, the next row has 3 blocks, and so on. Write a function `triangle` which takes the number of rows as a parameter and calculates the number of blocks that make up the triangle. You should implement this function: (a) Recursively, and (b) Iteratively.

| **# of rows (parameter)** | **# of Blocks** |
|:---:|:---:|
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 3 |
| 3 | 6 |
| 4 | 10 |
| 5 | 15 |

Test that both functions return the same value when called with the same parameters. 

## nox

Write a function `nox` that takes a string as a parameter and removes all 'x' characters:

| **Parameter (input)** | **Returns (output)** |
|:---:|:---:|
| "xendxstartx" | "endstart" |
| "endx" | "end" |
| "xstart" | "start" |
| "xxxx" | "" |

You should implement this function: (a) Recursively, and (b) Iteratively. Test that both functions return the same value when called with the same parameters. 

<!--## Demonstration

Once you've finished doing the HW a single time, you can watch me do it:

{% include youtube.html id="nTb-SeIGMCM" %}

### Solution for `text_steps` loop:
    def step_loop(txt):
	    for i in range(len(txt)):
		    print(txt[i:])

{% include wod-warning.html %}-->

### Submission

Once you're satisfied that your programs are working correctly, take a screenshot of each program open in the editor, with its output displayed in the console, and submit to google classroom. You should submit 2 screenshots.
