# WOD4: Functions


{% include wod-times.html Rx="<5 min" Av="5-10 min" Sd="10-20 min" DNF="20+ min" %}

### Setup

  * `mkdir wod4_uLogin`
  * `cd wod4_uLogin`
  * `touch is_odd.py square.py`

*Don't forget to add a comment at the top of the program with your name and what the program does.*

## is_odd.py

Write a function `is_odd` that takes a number as a parameter and returns true if the number is odd. Test that your function works by calling it twice, once with an odd and once with an even number. *Your program should **not** get any input from the user.*

## square.py

Create a program that draws a filled square of asterix characters, **requesting the width from the user**. Write a function `square` that takes the width as a parameter and prints a filled square.

For example, a call to `square(3)` should output:

    ***
    ***
    ***

### Submission

Once you're satisfied that your programs are working correctly, zip it for submission:

  * `cd ..`
  * `zip wod4_uLogin.zip wod4_uLogin/*`
