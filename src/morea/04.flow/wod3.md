# WOD3: Input, Ifs, & Loops

In this WOD you will create 2 programs that explore getting user input as well as using if statements and for loops.

{% include wod-times.html Rx="<5 min" Av="5-10 min" Sd="10-15 min" DNF="15+ min" %}

## sum.py

Create a program that calculates the sum of a series of 5 real (i.e., decimal) numbers entered by the user using a loop. Make sure you ask (i.e., prompt) the user to enter each number (the user will hit enter after each number).

## is_even.py

Create a program that asks the user for a whole number and prints the number followed by whether it falls into any of the following categories:

 * "is zero"
 * "is negative"
 * “is even”
 * “is odd”

For example, if the user entered -22, your program should print something like:

    -22 is negative and -22 is even

Here are some additional examples:

    0 is zero and 0 is even
    5 is odd
    -25 is negative and -25 is odd

Make sure to test your program by inputting numbers that are even and odd as well as positive and negative.
