# HW: For loops & lists

In this HW you will create 2 programs that use for loops & lists.

{% include wod-times.html Rx="<15 min" Av="15-30 min" Sd="30-45 min" DNF="45+ min" %}

## hello_loops.py

Create a program that does the following:

1. Using the `range` function, print the numbers from 1 to 10 (inclusive). Each number should be on a separate line.
1. Using the `range` function, print the multiples of 5 from 10 through -25 (inclusive) on the same line . The numbers should each be separated by a space. (*Hint*: use the `end` parameter to the print function like we did in class; see loop_fun.py.) Donâ€™t forget to print a newline after this loop by calling `print()` with no parameters.
1. Using the `range` function, print the multiples of 3 from -3 to 21 (inclusive). Each number should be separated by a comma and a space. There should not be a comma after the final number (21). 
2. Create a list of 5 book titles. Write python code to print `"I would like to read"` followed by the 5 book titles. Each title should be quoted.

## average.py

Create a program that calculates the average of 10 real (i.e., decimal) numbers entered by the user. Make sure you ask (i.e., prompt) the user to enter each number (the user will hit enter after each number). <!--Note you will need two numbers to calculate the average: the sum and the number of numbers entered by the user (10).-->



<!--## Demonstration


Once you've finished doing the HW a single time, you can watch me do it:
