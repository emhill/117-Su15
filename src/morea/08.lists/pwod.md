# Practice HW9: Recursion & Lists

In this practice HW you will create 3 programs that use strings, lists, and recursion.

{% include wod-times.html Rx="<30 min" Av="30-60 min" Sd="60-90 min" DNF="90+ min" %}

## mode.py

Create a program that calculates the most frequently occurring number in a list of 10 numbers. You may hard-code in a list of numbers rather than getting them as input from the user. You may use the python [mode](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/statistics.html#statistics.mode) function. 

## wheel.py

Write a **recursive** function `sajak` which takes a word as a parameter and returns the number of vowels in that string.

Write an **iterative** function `count_vowels` which takes a word as a parameter and returns the number of vowels in that string.

Test both functions by asking the user to enter a word, and printing the number of vowels found by each function.

## text.py

Write a function `pyramid` that takes a string of text as a parameter and outputs the text as follows:

    Enter text: we love CS
	w
	we
	we 
	we l
	we lo
	we lov
	we love
	we love 
	we love C
	we love CS
	we love C
	we love 
	we love
	we lov
	we lo
	we l
	we 
	we
	w

You may use *either* recursion *or* iteration in your solution.

Next write a function `is_palindrome` that takes a string of text as a parameter and outputs whether or not the string is the same forward & backward. For example, "Anna", "civic", and "rotator" are example palindrome words; "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama" and "Emilyâ€™s sassy lime" are example palindrome phrases.

Test your functions by getting a string of text from the user and printing the results of both functions.
