# Project 2: Turtle Drawing

In the beginning of the semester we drew interesting shapes on code.org. In this project, we will use the [turtle module](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/turtle.html) to draw shapes both iteratively and recursively. In this project, we will use loops, functions, conditions, and variables to draw pictures with the python turtle package.

**You may work with a partner**; make sure both students are clearly identified in the comments at the top of each program.

An important skill as a computer scientist is the ability to learn how to use an existing API library by reading documentation, finding good API usage examples on the internet, and adapting those examples to meet your needs. In this project, you will begin building these skills to help you make the transition from the classroom to practice.

  * **VirtualBox users:** use `python` (*not* `python3`) to run your turtle programs
