# WOD2: Python Syntax & Variables

## UNIX & Python

## A simple python program

1. Create a folder `wod2_uLogin` where you replace `uLogin` with your Drew e-mail address before the @ sign.
2. Go into this folder by typing `cd wod2_uLogin` and create a python file: `touch bye.py`
3. Edit the file (`ped bye.py`):
    4. Create a variable to store your last name
    1. Print "Goodbye, ...!" and replace the ellipsis (...) with the variable that is storing your last name.
    1. Add a comment at the top of the file that explains what your program does.
4. Run your python program: `python3 bye.py`
4. Copy your python file `bye.py` to `byebye.py`.
5. Create a second program called `temp.py`, that:
    1. Has 2 variables:
        * degrees_f: holds a temperature in degrees fahrenheit (86)
        * degrees_c: holds the temperature in degrees celsius. To convert fahrenheit to celsius, deduct 32 from the fahrenheit temperature and multiply by 5/9.
    1. Prints the values of both variables with a string description, such as: "F degrees fahrenheit = C degrees celsius", replacing F & C with the values of your variables.
4. Run your python program: `python3 temp.py`. The degrees celsius should be `30`.
5. Once you're satisfied that your programs are working correctly, zip it for submission:
    - `cd ..`
    - `zip wod2_uLogin.zip wod2_uLogin/*`

## Types & Arithmetic

Answer the following questions when you submit your zip file to moodle:

1. Given the following values, what are their types:
    1. False
    1. 1926
    1. 'Hello'
    1. 42.7
    1. "True"
2. If the following statements are executed in order, what will be the values of each variable?
    1. x = 9
    1. y = 2
    1. a = x // y
    1. b = x % y
    1. c = x / y
    1. d = y * (a ** y)
3. What would be an appropriate name and data type for the following variables:
	1. A figure skating average score
    1. The Olympic Athlete with the most gold medals   
    1. The number of gold medals
