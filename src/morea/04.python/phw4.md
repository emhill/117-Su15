# Practice HW4: Input, Strings, and using Functions
<!--
{% include wod-times.html Rx="<10 min" Av="10-20 min" Sd="20-30 min" DNF="30+ min" %}-->

## Setup

  * `mkdir phw4_uLogin`
  * `cd phw4_uLogin`
  * `touch math.py mangle.py`

*Don't forget to add a comment at the top of the program with your name and what the program does.*

## math.py

Write a program `math.py` that takes a number as input from the user and prints out the following information using the math module:

  1. The floor of the number (e.g., `floor(3.75)` is 3)
  1. The square root of the number rounded to 2 decimal places <!-- factorial -->
  1. The absolute value of the number

## mangle.py

Write a program `mangle.py` that takes a string as input form the user and prints the string after performing the following operations:

  1. converting the string to all upper case letters
  1. removing the second character
  1. removing the last character
  
For example:

| **string** | **mangle(string)** |
|:---:|:---:|
| hellothere | HLLOTHER |
| 42 degrees Celsius | 4 DEGREES CELSIU | 

## Submission

Once you're satisfied that your programs are working correctly, zip it for submission:

  - `cd ..`
  - `zip phw4_uLogin.zip phw4_uLogin/*`
